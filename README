RAMFS - Source for RAM filing system and utilities ROM
------------------------------------------------------
RAMFS100 - source for RAMFS 1.00
Build with BeebAsm with:
 BeebAsm -i RAMFS100.asm -o RAMFS100.rom

RAMFS104 - source for RAMFS 1.04
Build with BeebAsm with:
 BeebAsm -i RAMFS104.asm -o RAMFS104.rom -D VER=104

RAMFS is based on DFS 0.90, and consequently shares the Tube handling bugs
that are present in DFS 0.90. RAMFS 1.04 fixes these bugs:

* OSWORD &77/&7F have the correct inter-byte Tube transfer delays so operate 
correctly over the Tube

* OSFILE and OSGBPB correctly claim the Tube before using it, and release it 
afterwards. This allows other code to use the Tube when RAMFS isn't using 
it. In particular, it allows RAMFS to be used with second processors such as 
the 6809 that use polled interupts for data transfer.

* Corruption of the Master soft key pointer is avoided.

* As RAMFS never claims any workspace, the workspace pointer is never 
initialised. The UTILS are changed to use stack workspace instead of the 
non-existant main memory workspace.

* Saving to USB from second processor uses the correct start address in the 
OSFILE control block.

* Error numbers for 'No disk', 'DFS not selected' and 'Image file too big' 
corrected.

* The *HELP syntax messages are corrected.

*RAMTrap (ON|OFF)
-----------------
You can use a second processor with a disk-based operating system with disk
images in the RAMFS drives, for instance Z80 CP/M or 6809 Flex. Using *DTRAP
will divert all floppy access to the RAMFS drives. However, it also disables
all other ROMs, so you can't use a hard drive.

*RAMTrap diverts floppy disk sector access to RAMFS without disabling any
ROMs so you can use a hard drive.

  *RAMTrap      turns on the RAMFS trap
  *RAMTrap ON   turns on the RAMFS trap and re-enables it after Break
  *RAMTrap OFF  turns off the RAMFS trap

To use it with a Z80 second processor, make sure you have a CP/M system disk
in RAMFS drive 0. Then press Break (not Ctrl-Break) to get to the * prompt.
Type *RAMTrap or *RAMTrap ON then type *CPM. If you use *RAMTrap ON you can
also press Ctrl-Break to boot CP/M.
